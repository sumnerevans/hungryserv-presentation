\begin{frame}{A bit about me}
    My name is Sumner, I'm a \textbf{software engineer at Beeper}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I graduated from Colorado School of Mines in 2019 with a master's
            in CS.
        \item I teach as an adjunct professor at my alma mater.
        \item I enjoy skiing, volleyball, and football (soccer).
        \item I'm a 4th degree black belt in ATA taekwondo.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause

    I became interested in Matrix when I was the chair of the ACM chapter at
    Mines. I was looking for an open source chat platform for the club to use,
    and Matrix fit the bill!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What I work on at Beeper}
    I am on the newly created \textit{Scaling} team.

    Our current objective is to prepare Beeper for rocket-ship growth.
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    \pause

    I was previously part of the \textit{Bridges} team. 

    Notable projects included:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Writing the LinkedIn bridge
        \item Adding bridge status reporting and message send status.
        \item Implementing massive stability improvements in the Signal bridge
        \item Implementing incremental infinite backfill in our WhatsApp and
            Facebook bridges
    \end{itemize}

\section{A bit about Beeper}

\begin{frame}{Beeper's mission}
    Our mission is to:\\

    \begin{quote}
        make it easy for everyone on Earth to chat with each other.
    \end{quote}
    \pause

    We specifically chose the word ``chat'' rather than ``communicate'' because
    we are focusing on \textit{people talking to one another}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is Beeper?}
    \begin{center}
        \textbf{Beeper is an app that brings all of your chat networks together into
            a single inbox.}
    \end{center}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/beeper-mobile}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is Beeper?}
    \textbf{Beeper allows you to consolidate messages from 15+ chat apps into a
        single inbox.}

    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beeper is available on on macOS, Windows, Linux iPhone, iPad,
            Android and Chrome OS.
        \item Beeper is built on top of the Matrix protocol.
        \item Beeper encrypts all chats, including bridged chats, by
            default\footnote[frame]{We have to momentarily decrypt your chat
            messages to translate from the other network to Matrix, but we never
            log or store your unencrypted messages.}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bridging to a glorious Matrix future}
    We see bridges as a way to onboard users into the Matrix ecosystem.

    Users can switch to a new app without loosing a single conversation!
    \pause

    \vspace{1cm}
    \begin{center}
        \Large
        \textbf{We encourage our users to connect \textit{all} of their chat
        networks to Beeper.}
    \end{center}
\end{frame}

\section{A bit about Beeper's current architecture}

\begin{frame}{A diagram}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/current-architecture}}

    Each user gets their own bridge for each network they connect.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Advantages of our architecture}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item ASMUX allows us to dynamically change what bridges are running
        \item Each users' bridge is \textbf{isolated}
        \item We can deploy \textbf{different bridge versions} to different sets
            of users
        \item Bridges can be stopped and started individually
        \item Double puppeting
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Disadvantages of our architecture}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item We have to run a \textbf{lot} of bridges
        \item Synapse is not designed for a dynamic numbers of bridges
        \item If two users join the same chat on an external network, we end up
            with two rooms with the same data
        \item We run Synapse on AWS which is relatively expensive
        \item Synapse becomes a bottleneck for all traffic
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Back to the diagram}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/current-architecture}}
    The core software in this architecture is Synapse.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Stats}
    Because we encourage users to connect every chat network, we have a lot of
    puppet users.

    \textbf{\large On average, each user brings 4716 puppeted users.}
    \vspace{0.4cm}
    \pause

    All of these puppets represent real people on other networks, so they
    each generate their own traffic.

    \textbf{\large On average, each user and their puppets collectively account
        for 100k events!}
    \vspace{0.4cm}
    \pause

    None of that traffic is federated, but it has to go to Synapse which is
    designed with federation front-and-center!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A few more notes}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item \textbf{Synapse is aggressively federated}

            Synapse has no special handling of federated vs unfederated rooms.

        \item \textbf{Synapse does not handle message floods well}

            Synapse falls over when users bridge some large Telegram chats and
            Discord servers.

        \item \textbf{Deleting rooms from Synapse is hard}

            We end up with lots of \textit{dead} rooms when users delete their
            bridges and never turn it back on (or need a hard bridge reset).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Our new architecture}

\begin{frame}{A sharded future}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/new-architecture}}

    Let's talk about the differences from the old architecture\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Splitting the homeserver, keeping the protocol}
    \Large
    \centering
    This new architecture allows us to handle Matrix-native federated traffic
    separately from our high-throughput unfederated bridge traffic.
    \pause

    \textbf{All while maintaining API compatibility with clients, bridges, and
    the Matrix federation!}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A sharded future}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/new-architecture}}

    Let's talk about the differences from the old architecture\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hungryserv: why is it hungry?}
    \Large
    Because it's unfed\pause{erated!}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hungryserv}
    We run a \textbf{Hungryserv} instance for every user to handle that user's
    bridge traffic.
    \pause

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item If there's a message flood from a bridge, it only affects that
            user.
        \item We don't have to store all of the bridge events and users in our
            Synapse database.
        \item Synapse is less resource constrained and can do what it does best:
            federate with other Matrix homeservers.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause[\thebeamerpauses]

    We are also currently looking into ways of using \textbf{SQLite} in
    production using Litestream.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hungryserv: aggressively unfederated}
    Each bridge belongs to a single user, so federation is unnecessary. \\
    \pause

    \begin{quote}
        When your DAG is a linked-list, don't store it as a DAG.
    \end{quote}
    \pause

    Being unfederated means that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item we can avoid implementing the state resolution algorithm,
        \item event storage requires less metadata,
        \item deletions can be optimized, and
        \item infinite backfill becomes an simple batch SQL operation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hungryserv: goals, and non-goals}
    \textbf{Goals}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Be fast
        \item Be compatible with Beeper clients (and mostly compatible with
            Element clients)
        \item Be API-compatible with the Appservice API for bridges
    \end{itemize}
    \pause

    \textbf{Non-goals}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Be federated
        \item Be fully spec compliant
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A sharded future}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/new-architecture}}

    Let's talk about the differences from the old architecture\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Roomserv}
    \textbf{Roomserv} is a service which splits client requests between Synapse
    and Hungryserv.

    Roomserv merges the responses from the two homeservers to make it appear as
    a single homeserver to the client.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A sharded future}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/new-architecture}}

    Let's talk about the differences from the old architecture\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{No more ASMUX}
    Hungryserv natively supports dynamic registration of app services, and knows
    how to route requests to the correct bridge.
    \pause

    \textbf{We no longer have to rely on the single transactions firehose from
    Synapse.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A sharded future}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.15\textwidth]{images/new-architecture}}

    Let's talk about the differences from the old architecture\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A multi-cloud future?}
    The resources for each user can be moved closer to them using a multi-cloud,
    or multi-region strategy.

    This will help reduce latency (especially to bridged networks) and allow for
    us to deploy in more flexible and cost-effective environments.
